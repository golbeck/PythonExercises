sqlite3 "database.db"
#displays tables
.tables
#In column mode, each record is shown on a separate line with the data aligned in columns. For example:
.mode column
select * from pdacosta;
#In "line" mode, each column in a row of the database is shown on a line by itself. Each line consists of the column name, an equal sign and the column data. Successive records are separated by a blank line. Here is an example of line mode output:
.mode line
select * from pdacosta;




.exit
